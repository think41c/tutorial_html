HTML rendered with 'tags' that are open and close with
a preceding / (eg. <p>Hello</p>). Some are self enclosed,
meaning they don't need a closing tag (eg. <title> ). You 
can also add the / at the end of self enclosed tags. 
(eg. <title/> )

having a completely separate file for the CSS) use this inside the <head>: 
<style type = "text/css"> ... </style>
